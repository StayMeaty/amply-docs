# Finding Causes
*Discover Where Your Giving Can Have the Most Impact*

Amply helps you find causes and organizations that align with your values and maximize your impact.

## Browsing by SDG

### What Are SDGs?

The United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals provide a framework for addressing global challenges. Amply uses SDGs to organize causes:

→ [Full SDG overview](../sdgs/overview.md)

### How to Browse

Navigate by goal:

1. **Select an SDG** that matters to you
2. **View organizations** working in that area
3. **Compare** their approaches and effectiveness
4. **Give** to specific organizations or the category

### Multiple SDG Support

Many organizations address multiple goals. For example:
- A water charity might address SDG 6 (Clean Water) AND SDG 3 (Good Health)
- An education nonprofit might address SDG 4 (Education) AND SDG 5 (Gender Equality)

Browse by primary or secondary SDG alignment.

## Evaluating Organizations

### Verification Status

All organizations on Amply are verified. Look for:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Verified | Passed verification, legally registered charity |
| Enhanced | Additional due diligence completed |
| Founding member | Early Amply adopter with track record |

### Transparency Score

How open is the organization?

Factors include:
- **Visibility**: What percentage of transactions are fully public
- **Update frequency**: How often they publish financial data
- **Responsiveness**: How quickly they answer inquiries
- **Verification depth**: Level of independent verification

Higher scores mean more openness.

### Effectiveness Indicators

How well do they achieve their mission?

Look for:
- **Impact metrics**: Quantified results
- **Cost effectiveness**: Cost per outcome
- **Independent evaluation**: Third-party assessments
- **Evidence base**: Research supporting their approach

## Using Filters

### Location

Filter by where organizations work:

- **Local**: Your city or region
- **National**: Within your country
- **International**: Global reach
- **Specific regions**: Africa, Asia, Americas, etc.

### Size and Scale

Match your giving style:

- **Large organizations**: Established infrastructure, proven track record
- **Mid-size**: Nimble with some scale
- **Small/grassroots**: Direct impact, higher engagement
- **Fiscal sponsors**: New initiatives with fiscal backing

### Focus Area

Beyond SDGs, filter by approach:

- Direct service delivery
- Research and advocacy
- Capacity building
- Emergency response
- Systems change

## Comparing Organizations

### Side-by-Side Comparison

Compare up to three organizations:

| Factor | Org A | Org B | Org C |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Transparency score | 92% | 87% | 95% |
| Public visibility | 78% | 92% | 100% |
| Primary SDG | SDG 4 | SDG 4 | SDG 4 |
| Geographic focus | Kenya | Global | India |

### Key Questions to Ask

When evaluating organizations:

1. **What problem are they solving?** Clear, specific mission
2. **How do they measure success?** Defined outcomes, tracked results
3. **What evidence supports their approach?** Research, evaluations, track record
4. **How transparent are they?** Open about finances, operations, results
5. **How efficient are they?** Cost per outcome, overhead ratio

### Effectiveness Philosophy

We believe in evidence-based giving. Not all approaches are equally effective, even within the same cause area. Amply helps you find organizations that:

- Measure what they do
- Report results honestly
- Adapt based on evidence
- Maximize impact per dollar

## Cause-Area Giving

### Not Sure Which Organization?

Give to an SDG category instead:

1. **Select SDGs** you care about
2. **Set allocation** (if multiple)
3. **Amply distributes** to verified, effective organizations
4. **You see** exactly where funds go

### How Allocation Works

- Verification status
- Transparency scores
