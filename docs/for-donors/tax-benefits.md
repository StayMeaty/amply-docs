## How Tax Deductions Work

### General Principle

In many jurisdictions, donations to registered charities reduce your taxable income:

1. You donate to a qualified organization
2. You receive documentation of the gift
3. You claim the deduction on your tax return
4. Your taxable income is reduced
5. You pay less tax

### Qualifying Donations

For a donation to be deductible:
- Recipient must be a qualified charitable organization
- Donation must be genuinely charitable (no goods/services received in exchange)
- Proper documentation required
- Filed within applicable deadlines

## Documentation Amply Provides

## Maximizing Tax Benefits

Instead of cash:

(Check specific rules and limitations)

- Immediate tax deduction

## Record Keeping

### What to Keep

- All donation receipts
- Bank statements showing transactions
- Organization acknowledgment letters
- Annual summary from Amply

## Common Questions

### Is my Amply donation deductible?

Donations through Amply go to verified charitable organizations. Whether your specific donation is deductible depends on:
- The organization's tax status in your jurisdiction
- Your personal tax situation
- Applicable limits and rules

### What if I covered the processing fees?

The deductible amount is your donation, not the fees. If you donated $100 and covered ~$3 in fees:
- You paid ~$103 total
- Your deductible amount is $100
- The fee coverage is not a separate donation

### What about international donations?

Cross-border giving is complex:
- Many countries limit deductions to domestic charities
- Some treaties allow cross-border deductions
- Organization may need local registration
- Consult a tax professional

### What if I donate anonymously?

Anonymous donations are still:
- Recorded on your Amply account
- Documented with receipts
- Available for tax purposes
- Just not publicly attributed to you
