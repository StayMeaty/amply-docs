*Understanding Tax Deductions for Charitable Giving*

Donations to qualified charitable organizations may provide tax benefits. This document explains how tax deductibility works when donating through Amply.

## Who Provides Your Tax Receipt

**The organization you donate to—not Amply.**

Amply is the technology platform that enables transparent giving. When you donate through Amply, your money goes directly to the organization via Stripe. The organization is the charity; Amply is the infrastructure.

This means:
- **Tax deductibility** depends on the organization's status in your country
- **Tax receipts** are issued by the organization, not Amply
- **Amply provides** transaction records and summaries for your reference, but these are not official tax receipts

For example:
- US donor → US 501(c)(3) org → Tax-deductible (org provides receipt)
- German donor → German gGmbH org → Tax-deductible (org provides Zuwendungsbestätigung)
- Any donor → Org without tax-exempt status in donor's country → Not deductible

Before donating, check the organization's tax status on their Amply profile.

## How Tax Deductions Work

### General Principle

In many jurisdictions, donations to registered charities reduce your taxable income:

1. You donate to a qualified organization
2. You receive documentation of the gift
3. You claim the deduction on your tax return
4. Your taxable income is reduced
5. You pay less tax

### Qualifying Donations

For a donation to be deductible:
- Recipient must be a qualified charitable organization
- Donation must be genuinely charitable (no goods/services received in exchange)
- Proper documentation required
- Filed within applicable deadlines

## What Amply Provides (Transaction Records)

Amply provides transaction records to help you track your giving. These support your records but are not a substitute for official tax receipts from organizations.

### For Each Donation

**Transaction Confirmation**
- Donation amount
- Organization name
- Date of donation
- Transaction reference
- Organization's tax ID/registration number (where available)
- Amply transaction ID for ledger verification

### Annual Summaries

For your personal records and to support tax filing:

**Consolidated Report**
- Total donations for the year
- Breakdown by organization
- Each organization's tax status
- Month-by-month summary

**Downloadable Formats:**
- PDF for records
- CSV for import

### Official Tax Receipts

For official tax documentation, contact the organizations directly:

- Most organizations provide annual acknowledgment letters
- Required for donations over certain thresholds (e.g., $250+ in US)
- Request through Amply or directly from the organization
- Organizations are responsible for issuing compliant tax receipts

(Check specific rules and limitations)

## Common Questions

### Is my Amply donation deductible?

Donations through Amply go to verified charitable organizations. Whether your specific donation is deductible depends on:
- The organization's tax status in your jurisdiction
- Your personal tax situation
- Applicable limits and rules

### What if I covered the processing fees?

The deductible amount is your donation, not the fees. If you donated $100 and covered ~$3 in fees:
- You paid ~$103 total
- Your deductible amount is $100
- The fee coverage is not a separate donation

### What about international donations?

Cross-border giving is complex:
- Many countries limit deductions to domestic charities
- Some treaties allow cross-border deductions
- Organization may need local registration
- Consult a tax professional

### What if I donate anonymously?

Anonymous donations are still:
- Recorded on your Amply account
- Documented with receipts
- Available for tax purposes
- Just not publicly attributed to you
