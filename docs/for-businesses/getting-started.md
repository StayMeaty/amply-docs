# Getting Started
*Set Up Your Business on Amply*

This guide walks you through setting up your business to give, collect, or both through Amply.

## Before You Begin

### Determine Your Approach

How will you use Amply?

| Approach | Description | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Corporate giving** | Your company donates | Business verification, bank account |
| **Customer collections** | Collect from customers | Business verification, integration setup |
| **Both** | Give company funds AND collect | All of the above |

→ [Corporate Giving](./corporate-giving.md)
→ [Customer Collections](./customer-collections.md)

### Gather Information

You'll need:

- **Business details**: Legal name, registration number, address
- **Authorized representative**: Someone who can legally commit the business
- **Banking information**: Account for giving or receiving payouts
- **Tax information**: Tax ID, VAT number if applicable

## Account Setup

### Step 1: Create Business Account

Start at Amply's business registration:

1. Enter business name (as legally registered)
2. Select country of registration
3. Provide primary contact information
4. Choose: giving, collecting, or both

### Step 2: Business Verification

Verify your business identity:

**Documentation:**
- Business registration certificate
- Proof of address
- Tax registration document

**Representative Verification:**
- Identity verification for authorized signatory
- Proof of authorization (board resolution, letter of authority)

Verification typically takes 2-5 business days.

### Step 3: Banking Setup

For giving:
- Link a bank account or card for donations
- Set up payment authorization

For collecting:
- No banking needed—funds route directly to organizations
- Optional: set up for corporate matching

### Step 4: Team Access

Add team members with appropriate roles:

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| Admin | Full access, settings, user management |
| Finance | Transactions, reporting, matching budgets |
| Marketing | Campaigns, public-facing content |
| Viewer | Dashboard access, read-only |

## Giving Setup

### Select Causes

Choose where your donations go:

**Specific Organizations:**

### Configure Giving

Set your giving preferences:

- **Amount**: One-time, recurring, or percentage-based
- **Schedule**: Immediate, monthly, quarterly, annual

## Common Setup Questions

### How long does verification take?

### Can we collect before corporate giving is set up?

Yes. Collection can operate independently. Corporate giving requires separate setup.

### What if we change our minds about causes?

Causes can be changed anytime. Changes affect future donations only; past donations remain as recorded.

### Do we need technical staff?

For standard e-commerce integrations (Shopify, WooCommerce), no technical staff needed. For custom integrations, developer involvement required.

### How do we handle multiple locations?

Enterprise accounts support multi-location setup with:
- Centralized or distributed management
- Location-level reporting
- Consolidated compliance
