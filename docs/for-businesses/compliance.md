# Compliance
*Regulatory Requirements for Business Giving*

Charitable giving by businesses involves regulatory requirements. This document explains what you need to know and how Amply helps.

## Why Compliance Matters

### For Corporate Giving

When your company donates:
- Donations may be tax-deductible (jurisdiction-specific)
- Proper documentation required for tax benefits
- Corporate governance may require board approval
- Securities regulations may require disclosure

### For Customer Collections

When you collect donations from customers:
- Charitable solicitation is regulated
- Customers must receive proper disclosure
- Funds must reach designated recipients
- Records must be maintained

Mishandling either can result in legal liability and reputational damage.

## Charitable Solicitation

### What It Means

Asking customers to donate is "charitable solicitation"—a regulated activity in most jurisdictions. Requirements include:

- **Registration**: Many jurisdictions require registration before soliciting
- **Disclosure**: Customers must be informed of key facts
- **Record-keeping**: Transaction records must be maintained
- **Reporting**: Some jurisdictions require annual filings

### How Amply Helps

**Reporting:**

## Tax Considerations

### Corporate Donations

For your company's own donations:

| Jurisdiction | General Treatment |
|--------------|-------------------|
| United States | Deductible up to 10% of taxable income (corporations) |
| Germany | Deductible up to 20% of income or 4‰ of certain expenses |

| EU (varies) | Country-specific limits and requirements |

*This is general guidance only. Consult your tax advisor for specific treatment.*
