# Customer Collections
*Let Your Customers Give—With Confidence*

When you collect donations from customers, you're handling their charitable intent. Amply ensures those donations are tracked transparently, protecting customer trust and your reputation.

## Why This Matters

Customer-funded donations are powerful but risky:

- **Trust**: Customers need to know their money actually goes to charity
- **Compliance**: Charitable solicitation has legal requirements
- **Reputation**: Mishandled donations become PR disasters
- **Accountability**: Customers increasingly demand proof

Amply solves this by routing customer donations directly to organizations—never touching your accounts—with full transparency.

## Collection Options

### Checkout Donations

Ask customers to donate at point of purchase:

- **Add-on donations**: "Would you like to add $1 for [cause]?"
- **Roundup**: "Round up to the nearest dollar for charity?"
- **Percentage match**: "Add 1% to your order for [organization]?"

Works with e-commerce platforms, POS systems, and mobile apps.

### Social Products

Products where proceeds go to charity:

- **100% products**: All profit to a cause
- **Percentage products**: X% of price goes to charity
- **Limited editions**: Special cause-related items
- **Subscription products**: Recurring social impact

Think "social beer" where the profit margin goes to water projects.

### Roundup Programs

Round customer purchases and donate the difference:

- Works with cards, apps, or POS systems
- Small amounts add up significantly
- Low friction for customers
- High participation rates

### Employee Giving

Payroll-integrated giving programs:

- Pre-tax deductions
- Employer matching integration
- Cause selection by employee
- Consolidated corporate reporting

### 2. Customer Donation

When a customer chooses to donate:
- Amount captured at checkout
- Donation flows to Amply (not your accounts)
- Customer receives confirmation
- Transaction logged on public ledger

### 3. Organization Receives

Funds reach verified organizations:
- Direct transfer (you never hold the money)
- Organization sees donation with your business attribution
- Customer can verify via public ledger
- Impact tracked by organization

### 4. Reporting

Full visibility for everyone:
- Your dashboard shows collection totals
- Customers can verify their individual donations
- Organizations see incoming funds
- Public ledger confirms everything

## The Money Never Touches You

This is important: when you collect donations through Amply, the funds route directly to organizations. Your business never holds donated funds, which means:

- No liability for holding charitable funds
- No regulatory complexity around fund custody
- No customer concerns about whether money reaches charity
- No accounting complications

You're a facilitator, not a handler.
