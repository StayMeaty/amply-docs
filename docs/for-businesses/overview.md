# For Businesses
*10-Minute Setup. Zero Friction. Real Impact.*

Most businesses want to support good causes. Most never do—because setting it up is a nightmare.

Traditional CSR programs mean hiring developers, weeks of integration work, ongoing compliance headaches, and expensive platform fees. For most companies, the barrier is too high.

**Amply changes this.** Install a plugin. Choose your cause. Go live. That's it.

Give company money, collect customer donations, or both—with full transparency, zero platform fees, and setup measured in minutes, not months.

## Two Roles, One Platform

### As a Donor

Your company gives its own money:

- **CSR donations**: Support causes aligned with your values
- **Matching gifts**: Match employee or customer donations
- **Cause partnerships**: Ongoing support for specific organizations
- **Disaster response**: Quick giving when crises hit

All corporate giving is tracked on Amply's transparent ledger, providing verifiable proof of your social impact.

### As a Collector

Your company facilitates giving by others:

- **Checkout donations**: Ask customers to add a donation
- **Percentage of sales**: "X% of this purchase goes to..."
- **Social products**: Products where all profit goes to charity
- **Employee giving**: Payroll deductions and giving programs
- **Roundup programs**: Round purchases to nearest dollar, donate the difference

Collected funds flow through Amply's transparent infrastructure—never touching your accounts—with full visibility for customers.

### Both Together

Many businesses combine these roles:

- Collect customer donations AND match them with corporate funds
- Offer social products AND donate a percentage of regular sales
- Run employee giving programs AND provide corporate matching

Amply handles both sides with unified reporting and transparency.

### Verifiable Impact

Every claim is backed by data:

- "We donated X" is verifiable on the public ledger
- "Our customers donated Y" is independently confirmable
- No greenwashing—transparent giving builds authentic trust

Embed a live donation counter on your site. Show real numbers, not marketing claims.

### Zero Platform Fees

Amply takes no cut of donations. Your giving—and your customers' giving—goes where it's meant to go. Only unavoidable payment processing fees apply.

### Compliance Handled

Charitable collection has legal requirements. Amply handles:

- Charitable registration compliance
- Proper disclosure to customers
- Tax documentation
- Audit-ready records

You focus on giving. We handle the paperwork.

### The Amplifier Effect

Every touchpoint is a donation opportunity:

- Checkout donations alone: modest impact
- Add roundup program: 2x donations
- Add social products: 3x donations
- Add employee matching: 5x donations

Amply makes it easy to activate multiple touchpoints. Each one amplifies your total impact—and it's all tracked in one place.
