# Corporate Giving
*Your Company's Donations, Verified and Visible*

When your business donates, Amply ensures those donations are tracked, verified, and provable—turning charitable claims into verifiable facts.

## Why This Matters

Corporate philanthropy claims are often unverifiable:
- "We support local communities" (how much? where?)
- "We're committed to sustainability" (what did you actually give?)
- "We donated to disaster relief" (can anyone confirm this?)

Amply changes this. Every corporate donation is recorded on a transparent ledger that anyone can verify.

## Giving Options

### Direct Donations

Give to specific organizations:

- One-time contributions
- Recurring monthly/quarterly/annual giving
- Multi-year pledges with scheduled disbursement
- Restricted gifts for specific programs

### SDG-Aligned Giving

Donate to cause areas rather than specific organizations:

- Select one or more SDGs to support
- Amply distributes to verified, effective organizations
- Allocation visible and verifiable
- Rebalance priorities anytime

→ [SDG framework](../effectiveness/sdg-framework.md)

### Matching Programs

Amplify giving by matching:

- **Employee matching**: Match staff donations 1:1 (or any ratio)
- **Customer matching**: Match customer checkout donations
- **Campaign matching**: Match donations to specific campaigns up to a cap

Matching creates engagement while multiplying impact.

### Disaster Response

Quick, verified giving when crises hit:

- Rapid deployment to vetted responders
- Real-time tracking of relief contributions
- Consolidated giving to avoid inefficiency
- Post-crisis impact reporting
