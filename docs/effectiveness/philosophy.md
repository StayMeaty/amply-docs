# Why Effectiveness Matters
*Caring Isn't the Same as Helping*

Transparency shows where money goes. Effectiveness shows what it achieves.

## The Problem with Good Intentions

Most people give to causes that feel meaningful. A compelling story, a striking image, a personal connection—these drive donation decisions. And there's nothing wrong with caring.

But caring isn't the same as helping. A dollar given to one organization might save a life. The same dollar given elsewhere might accomplish very little. The difference isn't about which cause matters more—it's about which organization turns donations into real impact.

We believe donors deserve to know not just where their money goes, but what it accomplishes.

## What Effectiveness Means

Effectiveness isn't about overhead ratios or administrative costs. Those metrics are easy to measure but often misleading. An organization with 20% overhead that delivers transformative results is more effective than one with 5% overhead that achieves little.

Effectiveness means:

- **Measurable outcomes**: What changed because of this work?
- **Cost-effectiveness**: How much impact per dollar?
- **Evidence basis**: Is there proof this approach works?
- **Scalability**: Can this solution grow to meet the need?

## Inspired by the Effective Giving Movement

Amply's approach to effectiveness is inspired by organizations like [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org), which rigorously evaluate charities based on evidence of impact.

We believe this approach should be accessible to everyone—not just donors giving large sums, but anyone who wants their contribution to matter.

This doesn't mean every donation must go to a GiveWell-recommended charity. It means every donor should have access to clear, honest information about what organizations achieve with their funding.

## How Amply Approaches Effectiveness

### SDG Framework

All causes on Amply are classified using the [UN Sustainable Development Goals](../sdgs/overview.md). This provides a universal framework for understanding what problems organizations address.

### Impact Measurement

Organizations on Amply report their outcomes—not just activities, but results. We work to standardize this reporting so donors can compare impact across organizations.

### Transparency Enables Effectiveness

Effectiveness requires honesty. Organizations must be able to report what works and what doesn't without fear of losing support. Amply's transparency infrastructure makes this possible by building trust through openness rather than spin.

When donors can see the full picture, organizations can focus on impact rather than marketing.

## Effectiveness Without Elitism

Some critics worry that effectiveness-focused giving favors certain causes over others. We understand this concern.

Amply doesn't dictate which causes matter. Climate action, education, health, poverty, arts, local community—all have value. The SDGs themselves span 17 different areas.

What we do say: within any cause area, some organizations are more effective than others. Donors deserve to know which ones.

## The Pragmatic Case

Effectiveness isn't just ethically right—it's practically better for the entire sector.

Organizations that can demonstrate impact attract more support. Donors who see results give more consistently. A sector that proves its value earns public trust.

We believe that making effectiveness visible—through honest measurement and transparent reporting—creates a system where doing good and doing well align.
