# How SDGs Frame Effectiveness
*From Goals to Measurable Outcomes*

The [UN Sustainable Development Goals](../sdgs/overview.md) provide the framework for how Amply organizes and evaluates impact. This document explains how we apply SDGs to effectiveness measurement.

## SDGs as a Universal Language

The 17 SDGs cover the full spectrum of global challenges—poverty, health, education, climate, equality, and more. By mapping all organizations to SDGs, Amply creates:

- **Comparable categories**: Organizations working on similar problems can be compared
- **Clear scope**: Donors understand what area an organization addresses
- **Global alignment**: The same framework used by governments, corporations, and NGOs worldwide

## From Goals to Indicators

Each SDG has official targets and indicators defined by the UN. These provide concrete metrics for measuring progress:

| SDG | Example Target | Example Indicator |
|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| SDG 1: No Poverty | Reduce extreme poverty by half | People living below $2.15/day |
| SDG 4: Quality Education | Universal primary education | Primary school completion rate |
| SDG 6: Clean Water | Universal access to safe water | Population with access to safe drinking water |
| SDG 13: Climate Action | Strengthen climate resilience | CO₂ emissions per capita |

Organizations on Amply report outcomes using indicators relevant to their SDG focus.

## How Organizations Use SDGs on Amply

### Tagging

When organizations join Amply, they tag their work with relevant SDGs. Most organizations focus on 1-3 primary goals, though some work across multiple areas.

### Reporting

Organizations report outcomes mapped to their SDG tags:

- What indicators they track
- What progress they've achieved
- What evidence supports their claims

### Comparison

Donors can filter and compare organizations within the same SDG category, understanding relative effectiveness within a cause area.

## SDGs and Effectiveness Together

SDGs answer: *What problem are you solving?*

Effectiveness answers: *How well are you solving it?*

Together, they give donors a complete picture:

1. **Find causes you care about** → Filter by SDG
2. **Understand what organizations do** → Review their SDG-mapped activities
3. **Compare effectiveness** → See outcomes and impact metrics
4. **Make informed decisions** → Give where your money does the most good

## Limitations

SDGs are a framework, not a perfect measurement system. Some important work doesn't fit neatly into SDG categories. Some indicators are hard to measure. Some impacts take years to materialize.

Amply uses SDGs as a starting point, not an endpoint. They provide structure and comparability while we continue developing more nuanced effectiveness metrics.

## For Organizations

If you're an organization joining Amply, you'll map your work to relevant SDGs during onboarding. This helps donors find you and understand your focus.
