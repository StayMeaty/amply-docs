# Introduction
*Amplifying Giving Through Infrastructure*

**Amply** is named for what we do: amplify giving. Every tool we build, every fee we don't take, every touchpoint we create—it all amplifies the impact of every donation.

We're a tech nonprofit building infrastructure for transparent, effective, and accessible charitable giving. Not another platform taking a cut. Infrastructure that multiplies what's possible.

## Why Amply Exists

Donating money should be simple. Knowing where it goes shouldn't require detective work. Finding the organizations that create real impact shouldn't be guesswork.

Amply provides the tools, platform, and infrastructure to make all of this possible—for individual donors, nonprofits, businesses, and fundraisers alike. Every transaction is logged and verified. Every organization is vetted. Every impact is measured.

Guided by ideals. Grounded in reality. We believe that when people can verify where their money goes, they give more confidently. When organizations can prove their impact, they attract more support. Transparency and effectiveness create a better system for everyone.

## Our Approach

Amply is built on a simple principle: **ultra-pragmatic transparency**.

- **Traceable**: Every donation is recorded in a tamper-evident ledger, linked to independent Stripe payment records
- **Effective**: We guide donations toward organizations with the highest measurable impact
- **Accessible**: Our tools work for a local food bank and a global NGO alike
- **Open**: Amply uses Amply to track its own finances—same platform, same transparency, publicly visible
- **Fee-free**: Amply takes no platform fees. Like the organizations we serve, we sustain ourselves through donations. Only unavoidable [third-party costs](./transparency/pricing.md) (like payment processing) are passed through

We classify all causes using the [UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](./sdgs/overview.md), providing a universal framework for understanding where donations make an impact.

## How Amply Amplifies Giving

Each part of Amply reinforces the others:

```
Zero fees → More money reaches causes
     ↓
Transparency → Donors trust more → They give more
     ↓
Effectiveness framework → Money goes to high-impact orgs
     ↓
Easy integrations → More touchpoints → More donations
     ↓
Infrastructure scales → Each new user benefits everyone
     ↓
RESULT: Amplified giving at every level
```

This isn't idealism. It's a system designed to multiply impact at each step.

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Organization Platform
*Free infrastructure that replaces expensive alternatives*

Most nonprofits spend 2-5% of donations on platform fees, plus hundreds per month on donor management tools. Amply provides everything—white-label donation sites, donor CRM, fund tracking, transparency reports—for zero platform fees. Money saved goes to mission, not overhead.

### 2. Out-of-the-Box Toolset
*The amplifier layer—more touchpoints, more donations*

Ready-to-use integrations that turn any website, store, or terminal into a donation point. Embeddable widgets, plugins for WordPress and Shopify, POS system APIs—deploy in minutes, not months. Each new touchpoint amplifies total giving.

### 3. Business & Individual Solutions
*10-minute setup for CSR, not months of integration work*

Businesses traditionally avoid donation programs because setup is expensive and complex. Amply changes that: install a plugin, choose your cause, go live. Businesses can donate company funds, collect customer donations, or both—with full transparency and zero friction.

### 4. Effectiveness Focus
*Guide donations where they do the most good*

Inspired by organizations like GiveWell, Amply helps donors find high-impact organizations. We evaluate and surface effective charities, so giving is informed by evidence, not just emotion. More effective allocation = amplified impact.
