# Our Finances
*Amply's Own Transparency in Practice*

Amply uses Amply. Our own finances are tracked on the same platform, with the same transparency, as every organization we serve.

## Why This Matters

We ask organizations to be radically transparent. We hold ourselves to the same standard.

You can see:
- How much money Amply receives in donations
- How we spend that money (operations, development, infrastructure)
- Our transparency metrics (what percentage is fully public vs. aggregated)
- Our fund balances and financial health

## How to View Our Finances

Amply's financial data is available through:

1. **Our public profile**: View our transactions, spending categories, and transparency metrics on the Amply platform
2. **Data exports**: Download our complete ledger for independent verification
3. **Annual reports**: Summary reports published each year

## What We Spend On

Amply's operational costs include:

### Infrastructure
- Cloud hosting and services
- Payment processing (Stripe fees on donations to Amply)
- Security and monitoring
- Data storage and backups

### Development
- Platform development and maintenance
- New feature development
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Open-source tool development

### Operations
- Team costs (salaries, benefits)
- Legal and compliance
- Administrative expenses

### Outreach
- Documentation and education
- Partnership development
- Community building

## Our Transparency Metrics

Like every organization on Amply, we publish transparency metrics:

| Category | Visibility |
|----------|------------|
| Donations received | Full public |
| Infrastructure costs | Full public |
| Development costs | Full public |
| Operational costs | Aggregated (HR details protected) |
| Legal costs | Aggregated |

We aim to keep the vast majority of our spending fully public, using aggregation only where necessary to protect individuals.

## Verification

You don't have to trust our reports. You can verify them:

1. **Compare to ledger**: Our reported totals match our ledger entries
2. **Check the math**: Our hash chain is publicly verifiable
3. **Third-party audits**: We undergo periodic independent audits

## The Multiplier Effect

Amply's operational costs are small relative to the donations we enable. Here's how to think about it:

**Traditional platforms:**
- Take 2-5% of every donation
- A €1M platform processes €1M, keeps €20-50K
- Donors fund the platform whether they want to or not

**Amply:**
- Takes €0 from donations
- Operational costs funded separately by mission-aligned supporters
- Every euro to Amply enables hundreds in donations to flow freely

**The math:** If Amply's annual operations cost €50K and we enable €5M in donations to flow with zero fees, every €1 to Amply unlocks €100 to causes. That's the multiplier.

This only works because:
- Our team is lean and mission-driven
- Our costs are infrastructure, not growth marketing
- Supporters see exactly where their contribution goes

## Supporting Amply

Amply sustains itself through donations. If you believe in transparent, effective giving infrastructure, you can support our work directly through the platform.

Donations to Amply are tracked with the same transparency as donations to any other organization. You can follow exactly how your contribution is used.

When you support Amply, you're not funding just another charity—you're funding infrastructure that amplifies every other donation on the platform.
