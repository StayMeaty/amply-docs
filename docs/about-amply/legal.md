# Legal Information
*How Amply Is Structured*

## What Amply Is

Amply is a technology platform that enables transparent charitable giving. We provide the infrastructure for organizations to collect donations and for donors to give with full visibility into where their money goes.

**Amply is not a charity that receives your donations.** When you donate through Amply, your money goes directly to the organization you choose—via Stripe, our payment processor. Amply facilitates the transaction but never holds the funds.

## Our Role

| What Amply Does | What Amply Doesn't Do |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Provides donation infrastructure | Hold donated funds |
| Verifies organizations | Receive donations on behalf of orgs |
| Maintains transparent ledger | Issue tax receipts to donors |
| Processes payments via Stripe | Provide tax-exempt status to orgs |
| Tracks impact and reporting | Determine how orgs spend funds |

Think of Amply like the road, not the destination. We build the transparent path between donors and organizations.

## Corporate Structure

Amply is operated as a registered nonprofit organization. We sustain our operations through donations to Amply itself—separate from the donations that flow through our platform to other organizations.

Details of our corporate registration will be published here once finalized.

## Payment Processing

Donations are processed through Stripe Connect:

- **Stripe** handles all payment processing, compliance, and security
- **Organizations** have their own Stripe Connected Accounts
- **Funds** flow directly from donor to organization
- **Amply** orchestrates but never holds the money

This structure means:
- Amply doesn't need money transmitter licenses
- PCI compliance is handled by Stripe
- Organizations receive funds directly

## Tax Deductibility

### Donations Through Amply (to Organizations)

When you donate to an organization through Amply, tax deductibility depends on **that organization's** tax status in your country—not on Amply's.

- The organization is the charity
- The organization issues your tax receipt
- Check the organization's tax status on their Amply profile

### Donations To Amply (Sustaining the Platform)

Donations to sustain Amply's operations are separate from donations through the platform. Tax deductibility for donations to Amply depends on our registration status in your jurisdiction.

## Data and Privacy

Amply processes data in accordance with applicable privacy laws:

- **GDPR**: We comply with European data protection requirements
- **Data location**: Operational data is processed on cloud infrastructure
- **Ledger data**: Transaction data on the public ledger is permanent by design
- **Personal data**: Can be anonymized upon request while preserving ledger integrity
