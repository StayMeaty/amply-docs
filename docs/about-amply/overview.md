# About Amply
*The Organization Behind the Platform*

**Amply** is named for what we do: amplify giving. We're a tech nonprofit building infrastructure that multiplies the impact of every donation—through zero fees, radical transparency, and tools that make giving effortless.

## What We Are

Amply is not a charity aggregator, not a payment processor, and not a fundraising platform in the traditional sense. We're **infrastructure**—the pipes and rails that make transparent giving possible.

Think of it this way: every euro that flows through Amply reaches causes more efficiently than through traditional platforms. We amplify giving by removing friction, not by taking a cut.

We provide:
- **Tools for organizations**: White-label donation sites, donor management, fund tracking, transparency reports
- **Tools for businesses**: CSR integrations, checkout donations, employee giving programs
- **Tools for donors**: Cause discovery, impact tracking, donation verification
- **Tools for fundraisers**: Campaign creation, community giving circles
- **A transparent ledger**: Every transaction recorded, verified, and publicly accessible

## What We Believe

**Guided by ideals. Grounded in reality.**

We believe:
- Transparency builds trust, and trust increases giving
- Effectiveness should inform giving decisions, not just emotion
- Every cent should be traceable from donor to impact
- Privacy and transparency can coexist when designed thoughtfully
- The best infrastructure is invisible—it just works

## How We're Different

### No Platform Fees

Amply takes zero platform fees. We sustain ourselves through donations, just like the organizations we serve. This means our incentives are aligned with donors and organizations—we succeed when giving succeeds.

→ [Pricing and Fees](../transparency/pricing.md)

### How Zero Fees Is Sustainable

Traditional platforms charge 2-5% because they need to:
- Pay investors expecting returns
- Fund aggressive growth teams
- Cover high operational overhead

Amply is built differently:

- **Mission-driven team**: People who chose impact over market salaries
- **Lean operations**: Infrastructure costs, not growth marketing
- **Transparent funding**: Donors see exactly what we need and why

The math works because our costs are a tiny fraction of the donations we enable. When supporters see that every euro to Amply unlocks hundreds in donations to causes, funding infrastructure makes sense.

We're not competing with causes for donor dollars—we're multiplying what donors can achieve.

### We Use Our Own Platform

Amply's finances are tracked on Amply. Same platform, same transparency, same rules. You can see exactly how we use donations to Amply.

### Privacy Without Opacity

We've designed a system where transparency and privacy coexist. Sensitive data (HR, legal, security) can be protected while still being cryptographically accountable.

→ [Transparency & Privacy](../transparency/privacy.md)

### Effectiveness Focus

Inspired by organizations like GiveWell, we help donors find where their money does the most good. All causes are classified using the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

## Our Commitments

1. **Every cent on the ledger**: No off-book payments, no shadow categories
2. **Zero platform fees**: We sustain ourselves through donations
3. **Tamper-evident records**: Hash chains ensure records can't be altered after recording
4. **Independent verification**: Donations link to Stripe payment records outside our control
5. **Privacy with accountability**: Protect people, not money
6. **Open verification**: Anyone can audit our data
7. **Transparency about ourselves**: Our finances are public too
