# For Fundraisers
*Rally Your Community for Causes That Matter*

Fundraisers are individuals who collect donations on behalf of verified organizations. You're not giving your own money—you're inspiring others to give.

## What Is Fundraising on Amply?

### Your Role

As a fundraiser, you:
- Create campaigns for verified causes
- Share with your network
- Encourage donations
- Track progress and celebrate milestones

Donations go directly to organizations—never to you.

### How It Works

1. **Choose an organization**: Select from Amply's verified nonprofits
2. **Create your campaign**: Set a goal, tell your story
3. **Share widely**: Social media, email, word of mouth
4. **Collect donations**: Friends and followers give through your page
5. **Watch impact**: See donations reach the organization in real-time

### Key Difference

Unlike some platforms, Amply fundraisers don't handle money:
- Donations go directly to organizations
- No funds in your account

This protects everyone: donors, organizations, and you.
