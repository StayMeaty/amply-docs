# Getting Started
*Launch Your First Fundraising Campaign*

This guide walks you through creating and running a fundraising campaign on Amply.

## Before You Begin

### Understand the Model

Key things to know:
- You collect donations on behalf of organizations
- Funds go directly to the organization, not to you
- You need to complete identity verification
- All campaigns are reviewed before going live

### Choose Your Organization

Browse Amply's verified organizations:
- Search by name
- Filter by SDG category
- Review transparency scores
- Check what they're working on

You can only fundraise for verified organizations.

## Creating Your Campaign

### Step 1: Identity Verification

One-time verification protects everyone:

**What's Required:**
- Government-issued ID
- Current address
- Brief background check

**Why It Matters:**
- Protects donors from fraud
- Protects organizations from misrepresentation
- Protects you from false associations
- Maintains platform integrity

Verification typically takes 1-2 business days.

### Step 2: Select Organization

Choose who you're fundraising for:

**Direct Selection:**
- Search by name
- View profile and mission
- See current campaigns
- Check organization preferences (some may not accept fundraisers)

**SDG Category:**
- Choose a cause area
- Let donors choose specific organizations
- Or allocate to multiple organizations

### Step 3: Campaign Details

Define your campaign:

**Basic Information:**
- Campaign title (clear and compelling)
- Goal amount
- Duration (open-ended or deadline)
- Category (birthday, memorial, challenge, etc.)

**Your Story:**
- Why this cause matters to you
- Personal connection
- What you hope to achieve
- Call to action

**Media:**
- Cover photo
- Additional images
- Video (optional but powerful)

### Step 4: Customize Your Page

Make it yours:

- Campaign URL (shareable link)
- Color theme
- Donation suggested amounts
- Thank-you message

### Step 5: Review and Submit

Before going live:
- Preview your page
- Check all information
- Review guidelines compliance
- Submit for approval

→ [Fundraising Guidelines](./guidelines.md)

### Step 6: Approval

Amply reviews campaigns for:
- Accurate organization selection
- Appropriate content
- No misleading claims
- Guidelines compliance

Most campaigns approved within 24 hours.

## Launching Your Campaign

### Share Immediately

First momentum matters:

**Social Media:**
- Post on your profiles
- Share in relevant groups
- Tag friends who might care
- Use organization's hashtags

**Personal Outreach:**
- Email close contacts first
- Personal messages convert better
- Ask for shares, not just donations

**Your Network:**

### Adjust as Needed

If things slow down:

- Ask for shares, not just donations

## After Your Campaign

### Celebrate and Thank

Whether you hit your goal or not:

## Campaign Tips

### What Works

- **Personal stories**: Share why you care
- **Specific goals**: "Fund 10 school supplies kits"
- **Clear asks**: Tell people exactly what to do
- **Visual content**: Photos and videos increase giving
- **Regular updates**: Keep momentum going
- **Personal outreach**: Individual asks outperform broadcasts

### What Doesn't

- Vague or generic appeals
- Set-and-forget campaigns
- Only broadcast sharing
- Unrealistic goals
- Unclear organization connection

### Best Practices

1. **Start strong**: Early momentum attracts more
2. **Be authentic**: Your story matters
3. **Make it easy**: Clear links, simple asks
4. **Thank immediately**: Donors feel appreciated
5. **Update regularly**: Show progress
6. **Close well**: Final push, then gratitude
