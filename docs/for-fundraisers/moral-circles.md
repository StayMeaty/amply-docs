# Moral Circles
*Community-Based Giving Led by Trusted Voices*

Moral Circles are ongoing giving communities organized around trusted leaders. Instead of one-time campaigns, Moral Circles create sustained collective impact.

## What Is a Moral Circle?

### The Concept

A Moral Circle is:
- A community gathered around a shared commitment to giving
- Led by an organizer (often an influencer or community leader)
- Focused on regular, collective charitable giving
- Transparent in decision-making and impact

### How It Works

1. **Leader creates circle**: Sets mission, values, focus areas
2. **Members join**: Subscribe to participate
3. **Regular giving**: Monthly or periodic contributions
4. **Collective decisions**: Community input on allocations
5. **Shared impact**: Celebrate results together

### Key Features

**Ongoing, not one-time**: Regular giving creates sustained support

**Community-driven**: Members influence where money goes

**Transparent**: All allocations visible, all impact tracked

**Relationship-based**: Trust in the leader and each other
