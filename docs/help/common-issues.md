# Common Issues
*Quick Answers to Frequent Questions*

## Donations

### My payment was declined

Your bank or card issuer declined the transaction. This isn't an Amply issue—it's between you and your payment provider.

**Try:**
- Check your card details are correct
- Ensure sufficient funds/credit available
- Try a different card
- Use bank transfer (SEPA/ACH) instead
- Contact your bank if the problem persists

No charge is made when a payment is declined.

### I want to cancel or get a refund

**Within 24 hours:** Contact support@amply-impact.org with your transaction ID. We can cancel before funds are disbursed.

**After 24 hours:** Funds have likely reached the organization. Refunds require the organization's cooperation. Contact us and we'll facilitate.

**Recurring donations:** Cancel anytime from your account dashboard. Cancellation takes effect before the next billing cycle.

### I was charged twice

First, check your account dashboard—you may have made two separate donations.

If it's genuinely a duplicate charge:
1. Note both transaction IDs
2. Email support@amply-impact.org
3. We'll investigate and refund the duplicate within 5 business days

### I didn't receive my tax receipt

Tax receipts are emailed immediately after donation. Check your spam folder.

**Still can't find it:**
- Log into your account → Tax Center → Download receipts
- Or email support@amply-impact.org with your transaction details

### My recurring donation failed

Usually caused by expired card or insufficient funds. You'll receive an email notification.

**To fix:**
1. Log into your account
2. Update your payment method
3. The next scheduled donation will use the new method

We retry failed payments once after 3 days before pausing the recurring donation.

## Organizations

### Our verification is taking longer than expected

Standard verification takes 2-5 business days. Delays usually mean we need additional documentation.

**Check your email** for requests from our verification team. Common issues:
- Document quality (blurry scans)
- Mismatched names (legal name vs. trading name)
- Incomplete beneficial ownership information

Email verify@amply-impact.org to check status.

### We need to update our bank account

1. Log into your organization dashboard
2. Go to Settings → Banking
3. Submit new account details
4. Verification takes 1-2 business days

Payouts pause during verification. No funds are lost—they queue until the new account is verified.

### A donor is disputing a charge

Chargebacks happen occasionally. When one occurs:

1. You'll receive notification from Amply
2. We provide Stripe with donation evidence (receipt, ledger entry)
3. The card network decides (typically 60-90 days)

**If the dispute is upheld:** Funds are returned to the donor and deducted from your next payout.

**Your role:** Respond promptly if we request additional information about the donation.

## Businesses

### Customer says their donation didn't work

Ask for their email or transaction reference, then check your Amply business dashboard.

**If you see the donation:** It worked. Share the transaction ID with the customer.

**If you don't see it:** The payment likely failed. The customer wasn't charged. They can try again.

### Our integration stopped working

**POS/Widget not loading:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify your API key is still valid (Dashboard → Settings → API)
3. Clear cache and reload
4. Check status.amply-impact.org for outages

**API errors:**
- 401: Invalid API key
- 403: Key doesn't have permission for this action
- 429: Rate limited—slow down requests
- 500: Our issue—check status page, retry later

Email developers@amply-impact.org for integration support.

## Fundraisers

### My campaign was rejected

Campaigns are reviewed for accuracy and guideline compliance. Rejection reasons:

- **Unverified organization:** You can only fundraise for Amply-verified orgs
- **Misleading claims:** Content doesn't match organization's actual work
- **Inappropriate content:** Violates community guidelines
- **Incomplete information:** Missing required fields

You'll receive an email explaining the specific issue. Fix it and resubmit.

### Donations aren't showing on my campaign

New donations appear within a few minutes. If delayed:

- Payment may still be processing (bank transfers take 1-3 days)
- The donor's payment may have failed
- Check your campaign dashboard for pending transactions
