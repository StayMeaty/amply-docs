# Pricing and Fees
*What It Costs to Give Through Amply*

Amply takes zero platform fees. This page explains what that means and what costs do apply.

## Amply's Fee: None

Amply does not charge platform fees, subscription fees, or percentage cuts on donations. All tools, features, and infrastructure are provided free of charge to organizations, donors, businesses, and fundraisers.

This isn't a promotional offer or a temporary policy. It's how Amply works.

## How Amply Sustains Itself

### The Short Answer

Amply is a nonprofit. Like the organizations we serve, we sustain ourselves through donations. People and businesses who believe in our mission contribute to keep the platform running.

### Why This Actually Works

Traditional donation platforms charge 2-5% because they need to pay investors, fund growth marketing, and cover high overhead. That model requires taking money from every transaction.

Amply is built differently:

| Traditional Platform | Amply |
|---------------------|-------|
| Investor-backed, needs returns | Nonprofit, mission-driven |
| Large teams, high salaries | Lean team, impact-focused pay |
| Growth marketing spend | Word-of-mouth, organic |
| High operational overhead | Infrastructure-focused costs |
| **Takes 2-5% of donations** | **Takes €0** |

Our costs are a fraction of what we enable. When €1 of Amply operations unlocks €100+ in donations flowing to causes, the math makes sense.

### The Multiplier Effect

This isn't about competing with causes for donor dollars. It's about infrastructure that multiplies what donors can achieve:

- Organizations save thousands on platform fees → more goes to mission
- Businesses get zero-friction CSR setup → more donation touchpoints
- Donors verify their impact → more confidence to give again

Every euro to Amply amplifies giving across the entire ecosystem.

### Full Transparency

Amply's own finances—income, expenses, operational costs—are tracked on the same platform, with the same transparency, as every other organization. You can see exactly how donations to Amply are used.

## What Fees Do Apply

While Amply takes nothing, payment processing isn't free. When money moves electronically, payment processors charge fees. These are unavoidable third-party costs that Amply passes through transparently.

### Stripe Payment Processing

Amply uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for payment processing. Stripe's fees apply to all transactions. For current and complete pricing, see [Stripe's pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing).

**Note**: Stripe fees may vary based on card type, currency conversion, and other factors. The exact fee for each transaction is recorded in Amply's ledger and visible in transaction details.

### Fee-Free Payment Options

Not all payment methods incur fees. Direct bank transfers (SEPA in Europe, ACH in the US) often have no transaction fees or significantly lower fees than card payments. For larger donations or regular giving, bank transfers can be a good option to ensure more of your money reaches the cause.

Available payment methods vary by region and are shown during the donation process.

## Who Pays the Fees

When transaction fees apply, donors choose who covers them:

### Option A: Donor Covers Fees (Default, Recommended)

The donor adds the fee amount to their payment, so the organization receives the full intended donation.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Donation to organization | €500.00 |
| Stripe fee (1.5% + €0.25) | €7.75 |
| Amply fee | €0.00 |
| **Donor pays** | **€507.75** |
| **Organization receives** | **€500.00** |

This is the default option because it ensures your intended donation arrives in full.

### Option B: Fees Deducted from Donation

The fee is deducted from the donation amount. The donor pays exactly what they entered, but the organization receives slightly less.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Donation | €500.00 |
| Stripe fee (1.5% + €0.25) | -€7.75 |
| Amply fee | €0.00 |
| **Donor pays** | **€500.00** |
| **Organization receives** | **€492.25** |

Both options are clearly shown during the donation process, with a transparent breakdown before you confirm.

## No Payout Fees

When Amply transfers funds to organizations, there are no additional fees. The amount shown to donors is final—what you see is exactly what the organization receives in their bank account.

This means:
- No hidden deductions between Amply and the organization
- No surprise fees when money arrives
- The donation breakdown shown at checkout is the complete picture

Every transaction on Amply shows this breakdown transparently.

## Fee Transparency in the Ledger

All fees are recorded in Amply's tamper-evident ledger:

- The exact fee amount for each transaction
- Which third party charged the fee
- The net amount received by the organization

This means you can verify that only legitimate third-party fees were deducted and that Amply took nothing.

## Future Costs

As Amply grows, additional third-party services may be needed (currency conversion, specific payment methods, etc.). If new fees apply, they will be:

- Documented here
- Third-party only (Amply will continue taking no fees)
- Transparently recorded in the ledger
