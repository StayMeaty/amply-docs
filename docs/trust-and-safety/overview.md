# Trust and Safety
*How Amply Minimizes Fraud and Protects People*

Amply is designed to minimize fraud and maximize trust. This document explains how we protect donors, organizations, and the integrity of the platform.

## Why This Matters

Charitable giving depends on trust. When that trust is broken—by fraudulent organizations, misused funds, or deceptive campaigns—everyone suffers:

- Donors become skeptical and give less
- Legitimate organizations lose support
- The entire nonprofit sector loses credibility

Amply takes fraud prevention seriously. Not through heavy-handed restrictions, but through verification, transparency, and accountability.

## Our Approach

### Verification Over Restriction

We don't block participation—we verify it. Organizations, fundraisers, and businesses go through verification processes appropriate to their role. Once verified, they operate freely within the platform.

### Transparency as Prevention

Most fraud relies on opacity. When every transaction is visible, every claim is verifiable, and every organization's history is public, fraud becomes much harder to hide.

### Accountability Through Records

Amply's tamper-evident ledger creates permanent records. Bad actors can't erase their history. Patterns of suspicious behavior surface over time.

### Protecting Vulnerable People

Trust and safety isn't just about catching fraud—it's also about protecting people. Organizations working with at-risk individuals, activists, abuse survivors, or other vulnerable populations can use Amply's privacy features to shield identities while maintaining financial accountability.

## How We Verify

### Organizations

Before accepting donations through Amply, organizations must:

1. **Legal verification**: Prove nonprofit/charitable status with official documentation
2. **Identity verification**: Confirm the identity of authorized representatives
3. **Banking verification**: Link verified bank accounts for payouts
4. **Mission alignment**: Map activities to relevant SDGs

Verification depth scales with donation volume. Small, local organizations face lighter requirements than those receiving large sums.

→ [Organization requirements](../for-organizations/requirements.md)

### Fundraisers

Individuals running fundraising campaigns must:

1. **Identity verification**: Confirm their identity
2. **Organization selection**: Choose from verified organizations only (funds go directly to the org, not the fundraiser)
3. **Campaign approval**: Campaigns are reviewed before going live

→ [Fundraiser guidelines](../for-fundraisers/guidelines.md)

### Businesses

Businesses collecting or donating through Amply must:

1. **Business verification**: Confirm legal business registration
2. **Representative verification**: Verify authorized personnel
3. **Banking verification**: Link verified business bank accounts

→ [Business requirements](../for-businesses/getting-started.md)

## Ongoing Monitoring

Verification isn't a one-time event. Amply monitors for:

### Suspicious Patterns

- Unusual transaction volumes or timing
- Rapid changes in donation patterns
- Inconsistent reporting
- Complaints from donors or beneficiaries

### Reporting and Response

Anyone can report concerns about an organization, campaign, or transaction. Reports are investigated, and actions range from:

- Requesting additional documentation
- Temporary holds on payouts
- Public warnings on organization profiles
- Removal from the platform

All actions are documented and, where appropriate, made public.

## What We Don't Do

### We don't guarantee outcomes

Verification confirms an organization is legitimate—not that it's effective. Effectiveness is measured separately.

→ [Measuring impact](../effectiveness/measuring-impact.md)

### We don't block donations to verified organizations

Once verified, organizations receive donations without Amply approval of individual transactions. We're infrastructure, not gatekeepers.

### We don't hide problems

If an organization faces concerns, donors see it. Transparency means showing the full picture, including red flags.

## For Donors

### What you can trust

- Organizations on Amply are legally verified nonprofits
- Funds go where they're supposed to go
- Transaction records are permanent and verifiable
- Amply takes no platform fees

### What requires your judgment

- Whether an organization's mission aligns with your values
- Whether their approach is effective
- Whether their specific campaigns are worthwhile

Amply provides information and verification. Decisions are yours.

## For Organizations

Trust and safety requirements exist to protect you too. Verified status signals legitimacy to donors. Transparent operations build confidence. And a platform free of fraud protects the reputation of everyone on it.

→ [Organization requirements](../for-organizations/requirements.md)

## Reporting Concerns

If you suspect fraud, misuse, or policy violations:

- Use the report function on any organization, campaign, or transaction
- Email: safety@amply-impact.org
- All reports are reviewed within 48 hours

Reports can be anonymous. We protect reporter identity while investigating.
