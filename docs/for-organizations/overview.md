# For Organizations
*Stop Paying for Donation Infrastructure. Start Using It.*

Most nonprofits lose 2-5% of every donation to platform fees—that's €10,000 on every €500,000 raised. Add monthly CRM subscriptions, custom development costs, and compliance overhead, and fundraising infrastructure becomes a significant expense.

Amply provides everything you need—donation pages, donor management, fund tracking, transparency reports—for **zero platform fees**. The money you save goes straight to your mission.

## The Real Cost of Donation Infrastructure

| Solution | Platform Fee | Monthly Cost | Setup Time |
|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Typical SaaS platforms | 1.5-2.2% + per-txn | €100-500/month | 2-4 weeks |
| Custom development | — | €5K-50K one-time | 2-6 months |
| Spreadsheets + PayPal | 2.9% | €0 | Ongoing pain |
| **Amply** | **0%** | **€0** | **2-5 days** |

*Only unavoidable payment processing fees (Stripe ~2.9% + €0.25) apply. [Full fee breakdown →](../transparency/pricing.md)*

## Why Organizations Choose Amply

### The Money You Keep

Traditional platforms take 1.5-5% of every donation. That's money meant for your mission going to platform shareholders instead. Amply takes **zero platform fees** because we're a nonprofit too—we sustain ourselves through donations, just like you.

**Example**: A €500K/year organization on a typical platform loses €7,500-25,000 annually to platform fees. On Amply: €0.

### Trust That Drives Giving

Every transaction on Amply is recorded in a tamper-evident ledger. Donors can verify their contributions reached you. When donors trust that their money goes where intended, they give more—and give again.

### Privacy Without Opacity

Transparency doesn't mean exposing everything. Amply lets you protect sensitive information (HR, legal, security) while maintaining financial accountability. Hide faces, not money.
