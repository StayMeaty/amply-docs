# Requirements
*What Organizations Need to Join Amply*

Amply verifies all organizations to protect donors and maintain platform integrity. This document outlines what's required.

## Your Tax Status

**Amply does not provide tax-exempt status.** Your organization must have its own charitable registration to offer tax-deductible donations to donors.

Amply is a technology platform that enables transparent giving. When donors give through Amply, their money goes directly to your organization. You—not Amply—are the charity. This means:

- **You issue tax receipts** to donors (not Amply)
- **Your tax status** determines deductibility for donors
- **You maintain** compliance with your local regulators

### Tax Status by Jurisdiction

| Country | Required Status |
|---------|----------------|
| United States | 501(c)(3) or equivalent |
| Germany | Gemeinnützigkeit (gGmbH, e.V.) |
| United Kingdom | Registered charity with Charity Commission |
| Australia | DGR status with ACNC |
| Other | Local charitable registration |

Amply displays your tax status on your profile so donors know whether their donation is deductible in their jurisdiction.

:::tip No Tax Status Yet?
Organizations without tax-exempt status can still use Amply. Donations will flow normally—they just won't be tax-deductible for donors. Many fiscal sponsors can provide tax-exempt status for projects.

## Eligibility

### Who Can Join

Amply accepts:

- **Registered nonprofits**: Organizations with legal nonprofit status
- **Charitable organizations**: Registered charities in any jurisdiction
- **NGOs**: Non-governmental organizations with charitable purpose
- **Foundations**: Private and public foundations

## Verification Requirements

### Legal Verification

Prove your organization exists and has charitable status:

| Document Type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| Registration certificate | Certificate of incorporation, charity registration |
| Tax-exempt status | 501(c)(3) determination letter, equivalent in other jurisdictions |
| Governing documents | Bylaws, articles of incorporation |
| Annual filings | Most recent annual report to regulators |

Requirements vary by jurisdiction. Amply's verification team will guide you through what's needed for your location.

### Identity Verification

Confirm the identity of authorized representatives:

- At least one authorized signatory must complete identity verification
- Verification uses standard KYC (Know Your Customer) processes
- Government-issued ID required
- Verification links to the organization (not personal accounts)

### Banking Verification

Link a verified bank account for payouts:

- Account must be in the organization's name
- Micro-deposit verification or bank statement confirmation
- Account must be active and able to receive transfers

## Ongoing Requirements

### Good Standing

- Remain in legal good standing with regulators
- Promptly report any changes to legal status
- Respond to verification renewal requests

### Accurate Information

- Keep profile information current
- Update contact information promptly
- Report any changes to authorized personnel

## Tiered Requirements

Verification depth scales with donation volume:

### Tier 1: Standard
- For organizations receiving up to $50,000/year
- Basic legal and identity verification
- Standard documentation requirements

### Tier 2: Enhanced
- For organizations receiving $50,000-$500,000/year
- Additional financial documentation
- Board member disclosure
- Annual re-verification

### Tier 3: Comprehensive
- For organizations receiving over $500,000/year
- Full financial audit requirements
- Enhanced due diligence
- Quarterly check-ins

These tiers protect both donors and organizations. Higher volumes attract more scrutiny, but also signal greater trust.

## Privacy During Verification

Verification data is handled securely:

- Documents stored encrypted
- Access limited to verification team
- Not shared with donors or public
- Retained only as long as required

Your registration documents prove legitimacy—they don't become public record.

## Common Questions

### What if we're newly formed?

New organizations can join with:
- Proof of registration (even if recent)
- Founding documents
- Initial board/leadership identification
- May start at lower tier with path to upgrade

### What about international organizations?

Amply accepts organizations from most jurisdictions. Requirements adapt to local regulatory frameworks. Some high-risk jurisdictions may require enhanced verification.

### What if verification is denied?

Denial reasons are communicated clearly. Common issues:
- Missing documentation (easily resolved)
- Unverifiable representatives (need different signatory)
- Legal status questions (may need additional proof)

Appeals are possible with additional documentation.

### How long does verification take?

- Standard: 2-5 business days
- Complex cases: Up to 2 weeks
- Expedited review available for urgent needs
