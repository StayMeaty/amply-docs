# UN Sustainable Development Goals
*How Amply Classifies Causes*

Amply uses the [United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) as the universal framework for classifying causes and measuring impact.

## Why the SDGs?

The SDGs are the world's shared blueprint for peace and prosperity. Adopted by all UN member states in 2015, they provide:

- **Universal language**: A globally recognized framework that transcends borders and organizations
- **Comprehensive scope**: 17 goals covering poverty, health, education, climate, equality, and more
- **Measurable targets**: Concrete indicators that enable tracking progress over time
- **Interoperability**: Organizations worldwide already use SDGs, making data comparable

Rather than inventing our own classification system, we use what already works. Every organization, project, and donation on Amply maps to one or more SDGs—making it easy to find causes you care about and understand where your money makes an impact.

## How Amply Uses SDGs

### For Organizations

When organizations join Amply, they tag their work with relevant SDGs. A food bank might tag SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). A school-building charity might tag SDG 4 (Quality Education). Many organizations work across multiple goals.

### For Donors

Browse causes by the goals that matter to you. Filter by SDG to find organizations working on climate action, gender equality, clean water, or any combination of goals. And since [Amply takes no platform fees](../transparency/pricing.md), your entire donation reaches the cause you choose (minus only unavoidable payment processing costs).

### For Reporting

Track your impact by SDG. See how your donations distribute across the global goals and understand your contribution to each area.

### For Businesses

Map your CSR initiatives to the SDGs. Report on your giving aligned with the same framework used in corporate sustainability reporting worldwide.
